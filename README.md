`hello` is a `c++` "Hello World" app
---
`main.cpp` can be compiled using `g++` and the `-o` flag to override the default `a.out` output executable   
run `hello` via `./hello` from within its containing directory  

#`adder` is a simple 2-digit addition app
---
`adder` is compiled in the same simple way as `main.cpp` into `hello`, the program requests and then adds two floats
